# Airbnb-Price-Prediction-Analysis-in-Singapore
This project aims to predict the prices of Airbnb listings in Singapore using various machine learning techniques. The project uses a dataset of Airbnb listings in Singapore that includes information on the listingâ€™s location, number of rooms, amenities, and other features. The project uses a number of regression models to predict the price of a listing based on the features of the listing, and eventually attempts to conclude with which model is the best in its price prediction capabilities using multiple measure criteria.
